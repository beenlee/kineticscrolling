You know Google's official Google Maps http://maps.google.com has so-called kinetic scrolling (aka inertia scrolling) feature. Some say it is annoying and it should not be default, but I really like this feature.
Unfortunately, this feature is not available if you create a map using Google Maps JavaScript API V3.
That's where this little project comes in. It adds kinetic scrolling feature to your custom Google Maps.
It is just a pure JavaScript code and does not depend any external libraries other than Google Maps JavaScript API V3.

See [DEMO](http://kineticscrolling.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/sample.html).

To learn how to use this library, see [Usage](Usage.md).

We are back!
Since 21 Dec 2010, the kinetic scrolling had not worked properly. But I fixed it at last!
Enjoy smooth scrolling feature!
